What do we do when a JAMstack site needs interactivity? We use serverless functions!

This example takes advantage of Netlifyâ€™s Functions, but we could also use AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Serverless Functions, or any other serverless/lambda provider.

The static site is managed by Gatsby/React.
